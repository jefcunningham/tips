# Tips Codepath homework

This is an iOS application created for the Codepath prework assignment 

Time spent: ~10 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: User can input a bill amount and see the copmputed tips and totals for different tip levels.
 * [x] Optional: Create an animation
 * [x] Optional: Use a custom font
 
Notes:

I created the initial segmented selector interaction but decided it would be a better user experience to see all levels of tips at the same time grouped in a fun way by whether the service was considered: Meh, Good or Epic.
